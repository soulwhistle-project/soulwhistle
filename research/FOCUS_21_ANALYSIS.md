## Focus 21 Core Frequencies

### Primary State: MASSIVE Continuous Section

**Main Carrier Configuration:**
- **Left Channel:** 198.0-200.0 Hz
- **Right Channel:** 202.0-204.0 Hz  
- **Binaural Beat:** 4.00 Hz (theta/delta border)
- **Total Duration:** 1,480 seconds (24.7 minutes)
- **Number of Sections:** 12 sections using 4 Hz theta

### The Epic 940-Second Plateau (Section 21)

**Time:** 955s - 1,895s (15.7 minutes CONTINUOUS!)

- Left: 198.0 Hz
- Right: 202.0 Hz
- Binaural: 4.00 Hz

**This is the LONGEST continuous single-frequency section in any Focus level analyzed!**

Comparison:
- Focus 10 main section: 330 seconds (5.5 min)
- Focus 12 main section: 305 seconds (5 min) - though 18+ min total at 1.5 Hz
- Focus 15 main section: 265 seconds (4.4 min)
- **Focus 21 main section: 940 seconds (15.7 min)** ⭐⭐⭐

## Frequency Pattern Analysis

### Two Variants of 4 Hz Theta

**Variant 1 (Primary):**
- Left: 200.0 Hz
- Right: 204.0 Hz
- Beat: 4.00 Hz
- Sections: 9 sections
- Used most frequently

**Variant 2 (Slight variation):**
- Left: 198.0 Hz
- Right: 202.0 Hz
- Beat: 4.00 Hz
- Sections: 3 sections
- Including the massive 940-second section

**Note:** Only 2 Hz difference in carriers, same 4 Hz beat - likely same subjective effect

## The Significance of 4.00 Hz

### Border Between Theta and Delta

```
Delta range:     0.5 - 4.0 Hz
Theta range:     4.0 - 8.0 Hz
Focus 21 uses:   4.0 Hz  ← EXACTLY at the boundary!
```

**Why this matters:**
- Lowest possible theta frequency
- Deepest relaxation while maintaining theta characteristics
- May combine delta's depth with theta's awareness
- Perfect balance for OBE state

### Comparison with Other Focus Levels

```
Focus 10: 4.11 Hz  (mid-low theta)
Focus 15: 4.80 Hz  (mid theta)
Focus 21: 4.00 Hz  (theta/delta border) ← LOWEST
Focus 12: 1.50 Hz  (deep delta) ← For comparison
```

**Pattern:**
- Focus 21 uses LOWEST theta frequency
- Just barely theta (4.00 Hz exactly)
- Almost delta, but maintains theta quality
- May be optimal for maintaining awareness at deep relaxation

---

## Carrier Frequency Progression Explained

### The Complete Pattern

```
Focus 10: 100 Hz carriers  (baseline)
Focus 12: 100 Hz carriers  (same, deeper beat)
Focus 15: 300 Hz carriers  (3x higher! - "no time" effect)
Focus 21: 200 Hz carriers  (middle ground)
```

**Monroe's Strategy Revealed:**

1. **F10 (100 Hz):** Baseline, introduce binaural beats
2. **F12 (100 Hz):** Same carriers, go DEEPER with beat (1.5 Hz)
3. **F15 (300 Hz):** HIGH carriers for "suspended" state
4. **F21 (200 Hz):** MIDDLE carriers - balanced approach

### Why 200 Hz for "Bridge to Other Realities"?

**Theory:**

1. **Between F10/F12 and F15:**
   - Not as "deep/subliminal" as 100 Hz
   - Not as "present/alert" as 300 Hz
   - Middle ground = transitional state

2. **Harmonic Relationships:**
   - 200 Hz = 2x the 100 Hz baseline
   - Octave relationship may create resonance
   - Still perceptible but not overly conscious

3. **OBE Optimal:**
   - 100 Hz = too deep (may fall asleep)
   - 300 Hz = too alert (may stay too grounded)
   - **200 Hz = sweet spot for awareness + separation**

## Structure Analysis

### Phase 1: Introduction & Synchronization (0-370s = 6 minutes)

```
0-35s:    0.5 Hz delta (50 Hz) - Initial relaxation
35-95s:   0.5 Hz delta (50 Hz) - Deepening
95-135s:  0.0 Hz (50 Hz both) - Zero-beat synchronization
135-170s: 0.2 Hz (131 Hz) - Micro-beat transition
170-205s: 65 Hz gamma burst! - Neural activation
205-370s: 0.4 Hz delta (50 Hz) - Re-stabilization
```

### Phase 2: Transition to Focus 21 (370-955s = 10 minutes)

```
370-420s:  26 Hz beta burst (unusual frequency combination)
420-545s:  50 Hz gamma bursts (extreme transitions)
545-660s:  Continued transitions
660-710s:  4.0 Hz theta (200/204 Hz) - First F21 taste
710-745s:  Brief transitions
745-815s:  4.0 Hz theta (200/204 Hz) - Building F21
815-955s:  Final preparations
```

### Phase 3: MAIN FOCUS 21 STATE (955-1895s = 15.7 minutes!) ⭐

```
955-1895s: 4.0 Hz theta (198/202 Hz carriers)
           CONTINUOUS, UNINTERRUPTED
           The longest sustained section in any Focus level
           The "Bridge to Other Realities" plateau
```

### Phase 4: Deepening & Exploration (1895-2235s = 5.7 minutes)

```
1895-1930s: Transition
1930-1995s: 4.0 Hz theta (198/202 Hz) - Re-entry to F21
1995-2045s: Transitions
2045-2140s: Transitions
2140-2235s: 4.0 Hz theta (200/204 Hz) - Final F21 section
```

### Phase 5: Return Journey (2235-2405s = 2.8 minutes)

```
2235-2340s: Gradual transitions
2340-2395s: 16 Hz beta burst (alertness restoration)
2395-2405s: Final return to baseline
```

## Key Insights

### 1. Longest Continuous Entrainment

**940 seconds of uninterrupted 4.0 Hz theta:**
- No gamma bursts
- No interruptions
- No frequency changes
- Pure, sustained entrainment

**Comparison:**
- F10: Uses gamma bursts to prevent sleep
- F15: Fragmented sections
- F21: ONE MASSIVE CONTINUOUS SECTION

**Implication:** Once you reach F21, Monroe wants you to STAY there

### 2. 4.00 Hz = Theta/Delta Border

**Exactly at the boundary:**
- 4.0 Hz is technically the cutoff between delta and theta
- May provide benefits of both:
  - Delta: Deep relaxation, healing, unconscious access
  - Theta: Awareness, imagery, conscious navigation
- Optimal for OBE: Deep enough to separate, alert enough to explore

### 3. 200 Hz Carriers = Balance

**Middle ground between extremes:**
- More conscious than F10/F12 (100 Hz)
- Less alerting than F15 (300 Hz)
- Perfect for "bridging" physical and non-physical
- Octave of baseline (100 Hz × 2)

### 4. Minimal Disruption

**Unlike F10 and F15:**
- No extreme gamma bursts during main state
- No 393-457 Hz interruptions
- Smooth, continuous experience
- Allows deep immersion in F21 state

## Why This Works for OBE

### The Perfect OBE Recipe

**Focus 21's combination:**

1. **4.0 Hz Theta/Delta Border:**
   - Deep relaxation (delta quality)
   - Maintained awareness (theta quality)
   - Can navigate consciously while deeply relaxed

2. **200 Hz Carriers:**
   - Perceptible but not intrusive
   - Maintains connection to body awareness
   - Not so high as to prevent deep states
   - Not so low as to lose consciousness

3. **15.7 Minute Continuous Plateau:**
   - TIME to fully separate
   - No interruptions to break state
   - Can explore thoroughly
   - Build experience gradually

4. **No Gamma Bursts:**
   - Unlike F10 (needs bursts to prevent sleep)
   - F21 assumes you've mastered staying aware
   - Trusts your ability to maintain consciousness
   - Smooth, uninterrupted journey

## Comparison: Why F21 vs F10/F15?

### Focus 10 (4.11 Hz, 100 Hz carriers)
- ✅ Good for learning body relaxation
- ❌ Gamma bursts may prevent full separation
- ❌ Low carriers may be too "sleepy"
- **Use:** Foundation training

### Focus 15 (4.80 Hz, 300 Hz carriers)
- ✅ "No time" state is interesting
- ✅ High carriers maintain alertness
- ❌ Fragmented sections (2-4 min chunks)
- ❌ May be too alert for full OBE
- **Use:** Time distortion, consciousness exploration

### Focus 21 (4.00 Hz, 200 Hz carriers) ⭐
- ✅ Lowest theta = deepest while aware
- ✅ 200 Hz = balanced awareness
- ✅ 15.7 min continuous = TIME to separate
- ✅ No interruptions = smooth journey
- **Use:** PRIMARY OBE state

## Monroe's Progression Strategy

### The Complete Training Arc

```
F10 (4.11 Hz, 100 Hz): Learn to relax body while maintaining awareness
                        Gamma bursts prevent sleep
                        ↓
F12 (1.50 Hz, 100 Hz): Go DEEPER into relaxation
                        18+ minutes to fully surrender
                        ↓
F15 (4.80 Hz, 300 Hz): Learn "suspended" consciousness
                        High carriers maintain alertness
                        Time distortion preparation
                        ↓
F21 (4.00 Hz, 200 Hz): BRIDGE STATE - Apply all skills
                        Deepest theta with awareness
                        15.7 min to separate and explore
                        NO TRAINING WHEELS (no gamma bursts)
```

**Each level builds skills needed for the next:**
- F10: Body/mind separation basics
- F12: Deep surrender, letting go
- F15: Altered time perception, consciousness flexibility
